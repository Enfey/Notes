### Operating system level virtualisation
OS level virtualisation is a virtualisation paradigm in which the kernel permits the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances. A program running in one of these instances (containers here for simplification) can only see its own contents and devices assigned to that instance/container. This imposes less overhead than full virtualisation
