2^n = O(3^n)
2^n $\le$ c 3^n, c = 1, n0 = 1

3^n = O(2^n)
3^n $\le$ c . 2^n
(3/2)^n $\le$ c, fails at any c, as n approaches infinity, cannot be bounded by a constant

2^n = â„¦(3^n)

2^n $\ge$ c . 3^n
(2/3)^n $\ge$ c, fails for any c, as n approaches infinity, grows closer to 0. 

3^n $\ge$ c . 2^n 
(3/2)^n $\ge$ c, works for any c as n grows arbitrarily large. 

2^n is o(3^n)
2^n < c 3^n for any c, pick n0 = 1, larger base means rhs always exceeds, regardless of the constant.

3^n is o(2^n)

3^n < c . 2^n 
(3/2)^n < c, fails for reasonable c as n grows arbitrarily large, grows closer to infinity, and c > 0 and must hold for all values.
