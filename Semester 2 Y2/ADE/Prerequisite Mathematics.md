## Logarithms
Inverse operation of exponentiation.
> To what power must a specific **base** be raised to produce a given number.

 $logb​(x)=y$
 - b = base (>1)
 - x = result
 - y = exponent needed
If $2^3$ = 8 then $log2(8) = 3$

### Properties of logarithms
#### Product Rule
$logb​(M⋅N)=logb​(M)+logb​(N)$
#### Quotient Rule
$logb​(\frac{M}{N})=logb​(M)−logb​(N)$
#### Power Rule
$logb​(M^p)=p⋅logb​(M)$

#### Change of base formula (important)
Allows you to change base of logarithm, often changed to 10, aka common logarithm.
$logb​(M)=\frac{logk​(M)​}{logk​(b)}$

#### Logarithm of 1
$logb​(1)=0$
Any base raised to power 0 is 1.

### Example, need to be able to do in head
$log8 (2) = x$
$log8​(2)= \frac {log(2)} {log(8)​}$
$log8​(2)= \frac {log(2)} {log(2^3)​}$
$log8​(2)= \frac {log(1)} {log(3)​}$ via the power rule (2^3) = 3 x log(2)

## Arithmetic Series
Sum of terms of an arithmetic sequence, where the difference between consecutive terms (called common difference **d**) is constant.
> Formula:

$Sn​=\frac{n}{2}​⋅(a+l)$
Where a = first term and l = last term, n = total number of terms.
## Geometric series
Sum of terms of a geometric sequence where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor, called the common ratio, **r**.
> Formula

If r ≠ 1, where a is first term, and n is number of terms.
$Sn = a.(\frac{1-r^n}{1-r})$

If r = 1: 
$Sn = n.a$

Infinite geometric series:
$S∞​=\frac{a}{1-r}$


## Inequalities
$A < B$ implies $2a < 2b$
$A \le B$ implies $2A \le 2B$
$A \le B$ implies $A+C \le B + C$

$A < B$ implies $-A > -B$
$A \le B$ implies $-A \ge -B$
Etc.
