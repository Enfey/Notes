## Assume
Most commonly used: Variety of logical systems
==Introduces== a ==named assumption==, and ==changes== the ==goal== respectively. 
#### When to use w examples
``` lean
example (P Q : Prop) : P ‚Üí Q ‚Üí P :=
begin
  assume P : P,
  assume Q : Q,
  exact P,
end
```
##### Final goal state
![[Pasted image 20250119002509.png]]
#### Caveats
- ==Assuming== something that is '==not==' ==results in false== in the goal
- ==Assuming an inequality==, l==eaves the equality as a hypothesis==, and ==false as the goal==

## Apply
Most commonly used: Variety of logical systems
==Matches== the ==goal== with the ==conclusion== of a ==provided assumption== or ==lemma== to ==simplify the goal==/==generate subgoals== for its premises. 

WHEN APPLYING TO HYPOTHESIS OF FORM P->Q->R, CREATES MULTIPLE GOALS E.G., APPLY PQR RESULTS IN A GOAL WITH P, AND A GOAL WITH Q.
#### When to use w examples
Using lemma
```
example (b r : bool) (h : b = tt ‚Üí r = true) : b = tt ‚Üí r = true :=
begin
  apply h,
end
```
Proposition assumptions
```
theorem swap : (P ‚Üí Q ‚Üí R) ‚Üí (Q ‚Üí P ‚Üí R) :=
begin
  assume f q p,
  apply f,
  exact p,
  exact q,
end
```

Predicate assumptions

begin
  apply h,
  exact hP,
end
```
==APPLY TO NOT STATEMENTS WHEN HAVE FALSE IN GOAL==
### Constructor
Most commonly used: Inductive types
==Constructs== a ==term== for an ==inductive type== by ==splitting the goal== into ==subgoals== ==corresponding== to the constructo==r arguments.==
#### When to use w examples
`And`
```
example (P Q : Prop) (hP : P) (hQ : Q) : P ‚àß Q :=
begin
  constructor,
  exact hP,
  exact hQ,
end
```
When there is ```iff``` in the goal

begin
	constructor,
end
```

## Left/Right
Most commonly used:
==Chooses left or right branch of disjunction== goal to prove, ==changing the goal.==
#### When to use w examples
```
example : Q ‚Üí P ‚à® Q :=
begin
  assume q,
  right,
  exact q,
end

example : P ‚Üí P ‚à® Q :=
begin
  assume p,
  left,
  exact p,
end
```
#### Caveats

## Cases
==Performs case analysis== on ==inductive types== (types which have values specified from constructors). ==Generates subgoals== for ==each constructor== of that type.
Most commonly used: ==On assumptions only.==
CASES ON OR, 2 DIFF GOALS, DIFF ASSUMPTION IN EACH.
CASES ON AND, 1 GOAL, HAVE BOTH ASSUMPTIONS. 
#### When to use w examples
Booleans
```
example : ‚àÄ x : bool, x=tt ‚à® x=ff :=
begin
  assume x,
  cases x,

```

#### When to use w examples
IDK

## Em
Most commonly used: Classical logic
==Applies== the ==law== of ==excluded middle== to a ==proposition==, that is, either a ==proposition is true==, or its ==negation is true.==

==_principle of indirect proof_==¬†or in latin¬†_reduction ad absurdo_¬†(reduction to the absurd). This ==principle tells you== that ==to prove==¬†`P`¬†it is s==ufficient to show that¬†`¬¨¬†P`¬†is impossible==.

![[Pasted image 20250119020734.png]]


## Existsi
Most commonly used: Predicate logic
==Provides a witness== to prove an ==existential statement==. ==NEED THAT TYPE ASSUMED==, THEN ==PROVIDE IT AS A WITNESS== TO ==EXISTENTIAL IN THE GOAL.==
#### When to use w examples
```
example : (‚àÉ x : A, PP x) ‚Üí (‚àÄ y : A, PP y ‚Üí QQ y) ‚Üí ‚àÉ z : A , QQ z :=
begin
  assume p pq,
  cases p with a pa, -- cause it existential assumption
  existsi a,
  apply pq,
  exact pa,
end
```
![[Pasted image 20250119010659.png]]
IF GOAL IS LIKE THIS, CANT ASSUME, BOUND TO Z. must provide witness
## Rewrite
==Replaces occurrences== of a term ==using an equality==, uses an assumed equality to rewrite the goal.

#### When to use w examples
##### Rewrite
```
example:  ‚àÄ x y : A, x=y ‚Üí PP y ‚Üí PP x :=
begin
  assume x y eq p,
  rewrite eq,
  exact p,
end
```
##### Rewrite <-
```
example:  ‚àÄ x y : A, x=y ‚Üí PP x ‚Üí PP y :=
begin
  assume x y eq p,
  rewrite‚Üê eq,
  exact p,
end
```

## Refl
==Solves goals== where ==LHS== ==equals== the ==right hand side==, by r==eflexivity of equality.==
#### When to use w examples
Pretty obvious

## Symmetry 
==Swaps the sides of an equality in the goal==, also ==works for iff==.
#### When to use w examples
#### Caveats

## Transitivity
Introduces an intermediate step to prove transitive relations like equality or inequality. 
#### When to use w examples
#### Caveats

## dsimp
==Simplifies expressions== by ==unfolding definitions.== 
#### When to use w examples
bool
```
def band : bool ‚Üí bool ‚Üí bool
| tt b := b
| ff b := ff

def bnot : bool -> bool 
| tt := ff
| ff := tt

def bor : bool -> bool -> bool 
| tt b := tt
| ff b := b

theorem distr_b : ‚àÄ x y z : bool,
  x && (y || z) = x && y || x && z :=
begin
  assume x y z,
  cases x,
  dsimp [band],
  dsimp [bor],
  refl,
  dsimp [band],
  refl,
end
```

## Contradiction 
Looks for contradiction among the hypotheses of the current goal. Only ==tt = ff== and ==succ x== = 0 e.g., 0 = 1
Most commonly used:
#### When to use w examples
#### Caveats

## Induction
==Performs proof by induction for inductive types==. Ie, P==rove that the statement is true== for the ==initial value of ùëõ==, 0.  ==Assume the statement is true for some n==', the ==induction hypothesis==, and ==via this== ==prove== that if the ==statement is true for k==, the ==statement is true for k+1.==
#### When to use w examples
Nat
```
lemma add_succ_lem : ‚àÄ m n : ‚Ñï, succ m + n = succ (m + n) :=
begin
  assume m n,
  induction n with n' ih,
  refl,
  apply congr_arg succ,
  exact ih,
end
```


## Change
Same as dsimp, used to simplify goal though exclusively.
```
def is_tt : bool ‚Üí Prop
| ff := false
| tt := true
```

```
theorem cons : tt ‚â† ff :=
begin
  assume h,
  change is_tt ff,
  rewrite ‚Üê h,
  trivial,
end
```
Change results in:

## Injection
![[Pasted image 20250119021339.png]]
Used to extract equalities from an inductive type when have a hypothesis of the form f a = f b and f is injective.
#### When to use w examples
```
example :  ‚àÄ m n : nat, succ m = succ n ‚Üí m = n :=
begin
  assume m n h,
  injection h,
end
