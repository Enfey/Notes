# Case Study
## Stakeholders: 
Job applicants affected by unfair screening, potential loss of opportunity
Recruiters/hiring teams who rely on the tool: risk of poor hires, legal exposure
Employer: risk of reputation loss, financial(retraining + contractual losses) and legal risks
Immediate team and self- those responsible for the model quality and delivery.
Regulatory bodies - could become involved if harms occur
Society - wider systemic harms and backlash from biased automation

## Ethical dilemma:
Management is evidently giving precedence to financial procurement subject to deadlines over fixing a known bias in one of their products that discriminates. The ethical concerns are abundant. Discrimination, harm to applicants via known biases, negligence in product safety and quality, conflict between employer instruction and ones professional duty to minimise and avoid harmful system development.  Dilemma is either follow management instruction and NDA and ship the product, or act to prevent certain harm - risking employment consequences, 'corporate reputation' and legal exposure. 

## Relevant ACM code clauses:
Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems ACM 2.3
Be fair and take action not to discriminate ACM 1.4
Avoid Harm 1.2

## Next Actions:
Compliance with employer demand.
Refuse to participate in release. 
Advocate for human in the loop for all automation decisions, whilst still releasing. 
Advocate for postponement, with technical evidence provided and references to ethical and legal standards. 
Report to internal audit, ethics board, or general board if thereâ€™s a compliance function. This should be undertaken if postponement fails.
External whistleblowing undertaken if internal routes fail and harm posed is abundantly clear.
# Ethical Concerns company activities raise, and how professional codes of ethics apply to them 
## Ethical Concerns
- Bystander privacy and public safety - recording without notice or informed consent, may require visible/audible recording indicators and region-based automatic blur/blocking capabilities.
- Data security and breaches - sensor data(video, audio, location etc) highlights sensitive; server storage increases attack surface and makes for marked target. E2E encryption and minimum data retention enforced.
- Manipulation and targeting advertising and discrimination - free+ad model incentivises using personal life data to target and manipulate choices, potentially in a discriminatory manner. The nature of these advertisements may perpetuate or amplify biased patterns e.g., gender/role stereotyping.
- Consent under power imbalance

## Applicable professional codes of ethics
ACM avoid harm, respect privacy, be honest and trustworthy(about system limitations), Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks, Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure. GDPR/data protection law.
