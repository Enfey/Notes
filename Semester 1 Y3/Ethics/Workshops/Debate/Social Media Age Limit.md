> This house believes that the social media age limit should be enforced more heavily and raised to 16.

# Opening Speeches
## Proposition
- Social media age limit = min age to legally create and use an account, usually around 13
- Enforced more heavily = stricter verification and punishment for violations of imposed age restrictions.
- We postulate that young people under 16 cross-culturally are not emotionally or cognitively ready for the pressures and dangers of social media. 
- Social media contributes to anxiety, depression, body image issues, and cyberbullying; at 13, children are still forming their identity, without guardrails, children can have their identity and self-esteem tainted and lowered, respectively. 
- Children may be exposed to violence, pornography, hate speech, misinformation, harmful trends, and extremist ideas. In raising the age limit, children are protected from content they can't yet critically evaluate, and as such determine if they wish to consume it. 
- Younger teens don't fully grasp data privacy, online grooming, manipulation tactics, and cybersecurity practice. They cannot meaningfully consent to sharing personal data or being targeted by advertising. Like alcohol or driving, certain privileges should come with what society deems to be maturity.
- To effectively safeguard children, the imposition of a higher age limit on social media is of utmost importance. 
## Opposition
- Motion assumes that banning or delaying social media will protect young people, but restriction often causes more harm. 
- The proposition focuses on the negatives of social media, failing to recognise it as a force for social bonding, education, and self-expression for young people. 
- The focus should be on education of harms, digital literacy, and providing parental guidance, not outright bans. 
- Many teens currently use social media to maintain friendships, especially when isolated by geography or mental health issues, providing a sense of belonging and peer support that teens  may lack in real life. Cutting off access isolates vulnerable even more. 
- Social media provides immediate access to information, global issues, and activism. Many educational campaigns thrive on these platforms, giving young people the chance to get involved and have their say in wider society, whereas this would otherwise be restricted. Instead of banning, we should teach responsible use from the onset. 
- Teens already fake their ages to access social media, enforcement would be costly and invasive, ID verifications raises privacy concerns, and could exclude marginalised youths who lack formal identification, taking an ageist stance against the future generation. 
- Parents, not governments, know when their child is mature enough, blanket ban makes assumptions about the pace of development for children, proposing that they all develop the same, when it is known this is not the case. Varying factors, especially immediate environment affect mental maturity. 

# Rebuttal
## Proposition
- "Social media helps young people connect and learn" - those benefits can still exist in age appropriate, moderated platforms, suitable for children where they are not subject to harmful content via an algorithm that makes choices for them.
- "It's a parental responsibility issue" - makes the assumption that parents will monitor everything their children do, which is invasive. It is easier, and expected that tech companies and governments help by introducing such policies to assist parents in providing a safe and nurturing upbringing. 
- Protection is not restriction, is is preparation, just as we limit alcohol and gambling as they are classed as harmful exposures, we propose a limit to social media exposures via raising the age limit, investing in the mental health and safety of the future generations. 
## Opposition
- "Social media harms mental health" - posit that correlation is not equal to causation. It may be the case that poor mental health may drive more social media use, not the other way round. It is important to analyse such things correctly when implementing a potentially harmful policy.
- "Exposure to harm" - this ignores the continued existence of parental controls, filters, and age appropriate platforms - these harm avoidant tools serve the same purpose as an enforcement of greater age access, and thus would merely cause a paradigm shift, rather than achieving anything useful.
- "Younger users cannot consent" - this ignores the responsibility of the government, and educational institutions duty to teach online literacy from a young age - we cannot pretend that online harms are limited to social media, teaching online literacy helps them avoid harm and make informed choices earlier
- Bans create curiosity and rebellion, rather than fostering a protective culture, social media literacy is the true long-term solution to digital harm. 
# Closing

## Proposition
- Children deserve protection, not pressure, harm, and manipulation. 
- Social media can wait like any other maturity-bound privileges, this preserves the sanctity of childhood. 
- Stronger enforcement and a higher age limit undoubtedly safeguard wellbeing, privacy and natural, uninhibited development.
## Opposition
- Social media is the modern reality, exclusion will not solve its risks, as they represent something greater than just an application - social media is the representation of systemic social relations and tensions in a digitised microcosm.
- Thus, must teach children to navigate the inevitable, empowering them instead of punishing them for the systemic pressures and tensions that we adults are arguably responsible for. 
- A raised and heavily enforced age limit harms the future generations more than it will ever serve them.
